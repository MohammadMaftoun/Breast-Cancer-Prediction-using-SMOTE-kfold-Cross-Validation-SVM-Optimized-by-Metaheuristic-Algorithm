This project is aimed at creating a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis using the sklearn breast cancer dataset. The dataset is balanced using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and the model's performance is cross-validated using k-fold cross-validation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is optimized using a Metaheuristic Algorithm and compared to a genetic algorithm using the TPOT library.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Implement data preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality, handle imbalanced target class using SMOTE, and scale data between 0-1 using MinMaxScaler.
- **K fold cross validation**: The KCV consists of dividing the training set into k parts, each one consisting of l/k samples: k âˆ’ 1 parts are used, in turn, as a training set and the remaining one is used as a validation set. This technique can prevent overfitting!
- **SVM optimized by Metaheuristic Algorithm**:Machine learning model was support vector machine which optimized by a Metaheuristic Algorithm
- **Genetic algorithm**: Apply genetic algorithms to find the best parameters and suitable algorithm for this task.
